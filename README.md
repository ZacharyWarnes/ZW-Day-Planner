# ZW-Day-Planner

## Purpose of This Challange 

* By creating this daily planner program, we are learning how to add dynamic data to our application and save this data to local storage to be accessed at a later time. 

* In order to do this, it requries that we have a working knowledge of vanilla Javascript, Jquery methods, listener events, and using JSON to store groups of information in the application's locatl storage. We are also using methods from our previous excersies like For Loops and Comparatives to fufill the user's wishes in our assignemnt instructional. 

## How I completed this challenge

* In order to complete this assignment, we are to create a framework for time entry blocks for the user to be able to add their own scheudle items for that day and be able to return to them if need be. We were aslo required to color code the time of day to make it more visible to the user when they access the calendar App. For some of this formatting, we were allowed to use bootstrap, a css framework. 

* To add these color codes to the calander, I used a For Loop and comparatives to tell the applciation what time of day the user's input is being entered against what the actual time of day is. I then created a template literal to print a dynaimc time block that could change depending on the inputs. Last but certainly not least, I created a local storage method and key so that this information would remain on the page if it was closed and opened again using local storage methods taught in this course. I was able to link this function to the provided button in our starter code.

## Conclusion

* From this exercise I learned more about the functionality of Javascript and how information relevent to the application or webpage can be stored for later use. This storage method was probably the most significant thing I learned while working on this. I also learned how to use Jquery to target IDs and add/remove information dynamically depending on the users input.
